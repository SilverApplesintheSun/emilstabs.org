C
Climb that hill
C
Stay on your feet
G
Scramble for your footing
C
When it gets too steep

C
You’re on the highway now
C
With higher hopes
G
While all around are rolling
C
Eggs with living yolks

F
You never get too sad
C
You never get too blue
G
It must be all the chemtrails
C
Raining down on you

F
The justice of peace
C
Can’t help you any more
G
And they just took the covers off
C
The justice of war

CHORUS x 2
C
You get your nice shades on
C
And the worst days are gone
G
So now the band plays on
G
You got one life, blaze on

PIANO SOLO

The storm is passing through
Lay down your sticks and stones
The struggles over now
We’re all just flesh and bones

We were wrong before
It was wrong to trust
The shadows cast
Were only light and dust

And one day you find
To your intense delight
That three wrong turn can
Really make a right

So why not be like me
Be proud of all your crimes
Cuz when I screw up once
I do it two more times

CHORUS x 2

F
And we’ll be dancing in the fields
C
Running through the ??
G
Tripping on the barbed wire
C
Buried near the shore

F
Blazing  like a comet
C
??? in the full moon
G
so you better get ready
G
cuz a change is coming soon

F
I met a liar
C
Called the messiah
G
I got the frying pan
C
I wanted fire

F
I saw a red dress
C
I met a daughter
G
I got the quicksand
C
I prayed for water

CHORUS x 4
